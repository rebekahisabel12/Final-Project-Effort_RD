# Final Project Effort
##### <p>I followed the finally Barky refactor to close out the progress on my Analytical Method library.</p>

##### <p> The test_api.py file verifies the functionality of the Instrument and AnalyticalMethod models, ensuring that the API endpoints work as expected. </p>

##### <p> The tests.py file verifies the functionality of the AddInstrumentCommand to ensure it correctly creates an Instrument object in the database with specified attributes like manufacturer and sample type. It checks the database to confirm the correct creation and attributes of the instrument, validating the command's execution and integration with the Django model. </p>

#### <p> I hope to continue to develop this application as its real world use will benefit myself and my section largely. </p>
